What is my opinion on the companies, subjects, & projects i worked on.

give example for everything 


- Check le document rédigé pour D
- Lack of personnal : even an office manager is sometimes crucial engineers
- Lack of a combined short- mid -long term vision
- Equipements : Servers, VMs, even engineers laptop
- Lack of env of developement, not using the right tools, not using plugins & stuff like that

 - pressure to deliver instead 
 - Not the right profile for the tasks , using profiles as bouche trou for some tasks
- no good workflow for dev
- No good worklow at all for the n+ managers. For example, some companies takes days to validate a software used by some engineers due to non ability to install stuff with admin rights

- chaotic workflow for some managers, not using tickets, or proper tools but rather using emails & messages to assing tasks, what a horrible way to work.
- Other managers interrupts daily the tasks assigned to devs, everytime a client asks for something, they just rush and interrupt everything to deliver what the client wants

waht about lying 
What about interns & alternants ?
lack of mentoring, not a defined subject


My best vision is to have in your company, a way to generate revenue, and a team that works on research independently and have different vision. Invest in research if you want to innovate. There is no innovation without trying & searching & exploring.


another problem : avoiding technology
- example : some managers do not let their engineers work with AI assistant because they think they will be more stupid and rely on the AI . You need to know that not everytime it’s the case, Ai Code assistants aren’t meant to code all the time instead of you . they can rewrite stuff (wanna transform a json to a class & more )
- They can use templates for you. they can fill the parameters of a function for you .

- Running after the clients 
- Lying about the mission to hire people and assign them some unrelated tasks
- Thinking that a person can do a 3 person jobs just because they can split their times by 3 . My opinion is that some

- innovation =/= import hugging face …
