## Summarize AI conversation to be reused 
This chat is getting lengthy. Please provide a concise prompt I can use in a new chat that captures all the essential context from our current discussion. Include any key technical details, decisions made, and next steps we were about to discuss.

## General

**2. Reduce hallucinations:** At the end of your question, add, “_Do a web search and then reply._” This forces generative AI to give accurate answers.

**3. Apply the Feynman technique:** After AI explains a concept, summarize the same concept simply in your own words and ask “_Correct_?” AI will correct you if necessary. This method makes learning so much more engaging and also increases retention.

**5. Embrace the TL;DR:** This is a no-brainer. You can use this prompt for a lot of things. Summarize code, texts, emails, book pages, news, articles, and many other things throughout the day.

**6. Apply the Pareto Principle:** The 80/20 rule is a great way to learn new concepts. Example usage. “_I want to learn [topic]. Use the Pareto_ Principle _(80/20 rule) to create a course for me._”.

**7. Ask for movie recommendations:** Ask AI to give spoiler-free movie recommendations with reviews based on your preferred genres, actors, languages, etc.

**8. Use for web searches:** Instead of going to Google, Ask ChatGPT to find something on the web to bypass SEO-optimized articles and get relevant information quickly.

**9. Rate my work:** Ask ChatGPT to rate anything. This is the prompt you can use for it. “_Rate the above [article] in different aspects and suggest how I can improve it in those areas.”_ I use it to rate my code, articles, understanding, etc.

**10. Keep it short:** Add, **“**_**Give brief, clear answers that include all key details. Be concise but informative.**_**”** at the end, to get better answers.

**11. Enable Incognito mode:** ChatGPT has an option for temporary chat. When enabled, your data will not be saved in history and won’t be used to train the models.

<Context> The job market is highly competitive, with employers typically receiving hundreds of applications for a single position.

- Flag critical gaps or mismatches
    
- Assess years of experience relevance
    
- Evaluate technical skill alignment

    - A direct callout of critical gaps and weaknesses
        
    - An assessment of how likely the user is to receive an interview

    - Experience gaps and how to address them
        
    - Certification or education needs
        
    - Ways to reframe existing experience to better match requirements
        
    - Suggestions for more suitable roles if fit is poor
        

</Instructions>

<Constraints> 1. Maintain brutal honesty - do not soften assessments to be polite 2. Focus on evidence-based evaluation, not subjective opinions 3. Consider real-world hiring practices, not just idealized requirements 4. Avoid generic advice - all recommendations must be specific to the exact job and candidate 5.
