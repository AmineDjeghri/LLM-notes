- Flag critical gaps or mismatches
    
- Assess years of experience relevance
    
- Evaluate technical skill alignment

    - A direct callout of critical gaps and weaknesses
        
    - An assessment of how likely the user is to receive an interview
        
    - Whether the user should apply, upskill first, or look elsewhere

    - Ways to reframe existing experience to better match requirements
        
    - Suggestions for more suitable roles if fit is poor
