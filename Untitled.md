- 1. Direct lookup :
  Structural Understanding : which involve questions about the overall structure of the plot without requiring quantitative reasoning (e.g., the presence of grid lines or legend labels); 
- Value Extraction/data retrieval: which require extracting specific data values directly from the plot (e.g., reading exact numerical values or labels); 
- 2 Reasoning and multihop:  which involve numerical reasoning over multiple plot elements or comparative analysis (e.g., performing arithmetic calculations, comparisons, or interpreting trends)
